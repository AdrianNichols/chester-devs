Available:

* Graph DB Powerpoint Slides
* Neo4j Databases (copy these in to the Neo4j folder holding the default database)
* Neo4j Cypher Scripts
* Meetup Crawler
* SQL Database used for import data and the import data CSV


I've included the Meetup Crawler but not the database that it would create; as it trawls other people's data (public though it is), the code is included as a demonstration of how to use the neo4jclient - use or misuse of it is down to you!


Taking Graphs further
---------------------

If you want to use to neo4j to give a new perspective to data trapped in your RDMBS system and don't know where to start, give me a shout - I'm happy to help.
